# Citō Echo Example

:information_source: **Note:** Citō has not yet been released yet, therefore this must be build locally prior to running this.

Very simple webapp that uses [Citō](http://cito.io) and to echo responses back to the user. Simply run using

	mvn wildfly-swarm:run

...and navigate to <http://localhost:8080>.

That's it!
